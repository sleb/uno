## Object of the Game

Be the first player to get rid of all of your cards in each round and score points for the cards your opponents are left holding. Points in rounds accumulate and the first player to reach 500 points wins.

---

## Setup

1. Each player draws a card; the player that draws the highest number deals (count any card with a symbol as zero).
2. The dealer shuffles and deals each player 7 cards.
3. Place the remainder of the deck facedown to form a DRAW pile.
4. The top card of the DRAW pile is turned over to begin a DISCARD pile.

**NOTE:** If any of the Action Cards (symbols) are turned over to start the DISCARD pile, see FUNCTIONS OF ACTION CARDS for special instructions.

---

## Let's Play

The person to the left of the dealer starts play.

On your turn, you must match a card from your hand to the card on the top of the DISCARD pile, either by **number**, **color**, or **symbol** (symbols represent Action Cards).

**EXAMPLE:** If the card on the DISCARD pile is a red 7, the player must put down a red card OR any color 7. Alternatively, the player can put down a Wild card.

### Drawing Cards

If you don't have a card that matches the one on the DISCARD pile, you must take a card from the DRAW pile. If the card you picked up can be played, you are free to put it down in the same turn. Otherwise, play moves on to the next person in turn.

You may also choose NOT to play a playable card from your hand. If so, you must draw a card from the DRAW pile. If playable, that card can be put down in the same turn, however you may not play any other card from your hand after the draw.

## Functions of Action Cards

### Draw Two Card

When you play this card, the next player must draw 2 cards and miss their turn. This card may only be played on a matching color or on another Draw Two card. If turned up at the beginning of play, the same rule applies.

### Reverse Card

When you play this card, the direction of play reverses (if play is currently to the left, then play changes to the right, and vice versa). This card may only be played on a matching color or on another Reverse card. If this card is turned up at the beginning of play, the dealer goes first, then play moves to the right instead of the left.

### Skip Card

When you play this card, the next player is "skipped" (loses their turn). This card may only be played on a matching color or on another Skip card. If a Skip card is turned up at the beginning of play, the player to the left of the dealer is "skipped," hence the player to the left of that player starts play.

### Wild Card

When you play this card, you get to choose the color that continues play (any color including the color in play before the Wild card was laid down). You may play a Wild card on your turn even if you have another playable card in your hand. If a Wild card is turned up at the beginning of play, the person to the left of the dealer chooses the color that continues play.

### Wild Draw Four Card

When you play this card, you get to choose the color that continues play PLUS the next player must draw 4 cards from the DRAW pile and lose their turn.

**However, there is a hitch!** You may only play this card when you do NOT have another card in your hand that matches the COLOR on the DISCARD pile (but it is acceptable to play this card if you have matching number or Action Cards). If turned up at the beginning of play, return this card to the deck and pick another card.

**NOTE:** If you suspect that a Wild Draw 4 card has been played on you illegally (i.e. the player has a matching card), then you may challenge that player. The challenged player must show you (the challenger) their hand. If guilty, the challenged player must draw the 4 cards instead of you. However, if the challenged player is innocent, you must draw the 4 cards PLUS an additional 2 cards (6 total)!

---

## Going Out

When you play your next-to-last card, you must yell **"UNO"** (meaning "one") to indicate that you have only one card left. If you don't yell "UNO" and you are caught before the next player begins their turn, you must draw two cards.

Once a player has no cards left, the round is over. Points are scored and play starts over again.

If the last card played in a round is a Draw Two or Wild Draw Four card, the next player must draw the 2 or 4 cards respectively. These cards are counted when the points are totaled.

If no player is out of cards by the time the DRAW pile is depleted, the DISCARD pile is reshuffled and play continues.

---

## Scoring

The first player to get rid of their cards in a round receives points for all of the cards left in their opponents' hands as follows:

| Card Type              | Points     |
| ---------------------- | ---------- |
| All number cards (0-9) | Face Value |
| Draw Two               | 20 Points  |
| Reverse                | 20 Points  |
| Skip                   | 20 Points  |
| Wild                   | 50 Points  |
| Wild Draw Four         | 50 Points  |

Once the score for the round has been tallied, if no player has reached 500 points, reshuffle the cards and begin a new round.

---

## Winning the Game

The **WINNER** is the first player to reach **500 points**.

### Alternative Scoring and Winning

Another way to score points is to keep a running tally of the points each player is left with at the end of each round. When one player reaches 500 points, the player with the lowest points is the winner.

## HOUSE RULES

You may want to try some of the following "House" Rules when playing UNO card game.

### Stacking

Same rules as UNO card game, except:

1. When a player plays a Draw Two card, the next player may play another Draw Two card, causing the next player to draw 4 cards.

2. Same rule applies to Wild Draw Four cards: When a player plays a Wild Draw Four card, the next player may play another Wild Draw Four card, causing the next player to draw 8 cards. The last player to play a consecutive Wild Draw Four card calls the color to continue play. If a Wild Draw Four card is played illegally and the player is challenged, the usual rules apply, except that the penalty will increase depending on the number of cards played.

3. Players can continue to play consecutive Draw Two or Wild Draw Four cards, as long as they have them in their hands. For example, if 4 players in a row played Draw Two cards, the next player (who doesn't have a Draw Two card) would have to draw 8 cards.

4. You can only play one Draw Two or Wild Draw Four during your turn, even though you may have multiples of these cards in your hand.

### Jump-In

Same rules as UNO card game, except:

If you are holding the exact same card (identical color and number) as the card on top of Discard Pile, you may play it immediately, regardless of whose turn it is. For example: If a "Blue 6" is on top of the DISCARD pile and you have a "Blue 6" in your hand, you may play it even if it's not your turn. Play resumes from the player who played the last card (the player who "jumped in").

**Two important things to remember:**

1. If you have 2 matching cards in your hand, you may play them back-to-back, but they must be played one at a time (place one card in the DISCARD pile, reach back to your hand, then play the second). This gives another player a chance to 'jump in' and stop you from playing a second card.

2. If you "jump in" with a Skip, Reverse, Draw Two or Wild Draw Four, the second identical card played cancels out the first. (Follow normal UNO card game rules for these cards beginning with the player who played the second identical card.)

### Zero Rotation

Same rules as UNO card game, except:

Every time a "0" card is played, all players pass their hands to the next player in the direction of play. The player who played the "0" card continues play.

### Seven Swap

Same rules as UNO card game, except:

Every time a "7" card is played, the player who played the "7" card must trade their entire hand with another player of their choice (the chosen player does not have a choice in the matter). Play continues after the swap.

### Draw to Match

Same rules as UNO card game, except:

When you draw a card from the DRAW pile (because you have no playable card), you may continue drawing cards one at a time until you draw a card that matches the card on top of the DISCARD pile by number, color, or symbol. Once you draw a matching card, you may play it immediately in the same turn.
